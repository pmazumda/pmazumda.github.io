I started working on this blog last summer when I came accross GitHub pages and saw some people done some amazing work using Jekyll and  have developed this theme. I used to write previously on Blogger and even had a blog with the name [middlewarebytes](https://middlewarebytes.blogspot.com/){:target="_blank"},I haven't taken it down, although I wouldn't be publishing any new posts in it. I am also working on a travel blog with all my travel stories and recommendations, however that is still  Work in Progress and I would  update about it as and when it gets completed.

The idea behind working on this blog is I  am very strong believer in the above words.. I mean **yes**  daily we come across so many issues for which some of us might have a already known solution but not all of us. It's always good to receive positive and constructive feedback for your work - hence I would be more than happy if you have any suggestions or any other solution or ideas and feel free to scribe it down in my blog which I am working on where you can present your ideas and I will create a page. As of now you can mail me if you have any suggestions.

As it is being said :

> *In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power.If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it!*
