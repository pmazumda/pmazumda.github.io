subtitle: A few words about me and  why I am here...

I used to write previously on Blogger <i class="fa-brands fa-blogger"></i> , it was my collection of some important notes I had jotted down for referencing in future while working, I haven't taken it down yet, although I am not posting anythere in there. Since I am travel fanatic, currently I am also working on a travelogue with all my travel stories and experiences however that is something still **_Work in Progress_** and I hope to complete it soon.

I started working on this blog last summer and the idea behind working on this blog is that I am a strong believer in the below words..

> *In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power.If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it!*                                                                          
																		*-Joseph Badaracco*

I mean **yes** we can learn a lot from each other's learnings, experiences, mistakes; nevertheless the problems for which some of us might already  have the solution but not all of us and hence this is it  :blush:

It's always good to receive positive and constructive feedback for your work - hence I would be more than happy if you have any suggestions or ideas, so feel free to post it to me. **_Enjoy the read_**
