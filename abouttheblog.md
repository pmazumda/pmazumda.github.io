I used to write previously on Blogger and even had a blog with the name [middlewarebytes](https://middlewarebytes.blogspot.com/){:target="_blank"}, It was my collection of some important notes I had jotted down for referencing in future while working, I haven't taken it down yet, although I am not posting any new posts on it. I am also working on a travel blog with all my travel stories and recommendations, however that is something still **Work in Progress** and I would  update about it as and when it gets completed.

As it is being said :

> *In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power.If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it!*

I started working on this blog last summer and the idea behind working on this blog is that I am a strong believer in the above words.. I mean **yes** we can learn a lot from each other's learnings, experiences, mistakes; nevertheless the problems for which some of us might already  have the solution but not all of us and hence this is it :).

It's always good to receive positive and constructive feedback for your work - hence I would be more than happy if you have any suggestions or ideas, so feel free to post it to me.
