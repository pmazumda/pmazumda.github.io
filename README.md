# About

This repository contains the source files  for my personal blog which I am migrating from blogger to GitHub pages using Jekyll. 
For this  I am using beautiful jekyll theme by Dean Attali.

If you want to see the original work done by Dean Attali, you can check out it here [Dean Attali](https://deanattali.com)

I have also taken a lot of  references and inspiration from **Marco Blessing's** [website](https://OCram85.com)
I liked his customization and few of the details like how he has embedded his current projects within the home page. 

This blog is still in-progress and I am working on it. Due to some reasons, I am not able to dedicate enough time on it :), I am hoping to finish it off soon , probably by end of this quarter. 

Meanwhile , my current blog [Middleware Bytes](https://middlewarebytes.blogspot.com/) is  online and you can browse through the posts. I haven't taken it down, although I wouldn't be publishing any new posts any soon until i migrate it to my new site.

Till then , keep learning, keep sharing and stay safe..
