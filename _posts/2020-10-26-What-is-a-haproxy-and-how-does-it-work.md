### What is HAProxy ?

HAProxy (High Availability Proxy) is a TCP/HTTP load balancer and proxy server that allows a webserver to spread incoming requests across multiple endpoints.Recently it has become one of the commonly used open source load-balancer  for many of the  big websites around the world such as airbnb, reddit, tumblr and many others.It is particularly suited for high traffic sites,this is useful in cases where too many concurrent connections over-saturate the capability of a single server. Instead of a client connecting to a single server which processes all of the requests, the client will connect to an HAProxy instance, which will use a reverse proxy to forward the request to one of the available endpoints, based on a load-balancing algorithm.

Its mode of operation makes its integration into existing architectures very easy and riskless, while still offering the possibility not to expose fragile web servers to the net, such as below :

### Installation and Configuration


#### Installation

The source code of HAProxy which is covered under GPL v2 licence can be downloaded from the official [HAProxy site](http://www.haproxy.org/#down){:target="_blank"}.


#### Configuration

The primary and the defaulfft configuration file for HAProxy is /etc/haproxy/haproxy.cfg, which is created automatically during installation. This file defines a standard setup without any load balancing, following is a template for the haproxy.cfg with default configurations. The 


    ```

        log /dev/log    local0
        log /dev/log    local1 notice

#### Explanation:

- global : _The global section defines system level parameters such as file locations and the user and group under which HAProxy is executed. In most cases you will not need to change anything in this section. The user haproxy and group haproxy are both created during installation. The mode attribute controls  how the HAproxy server has to behave, for example in this instance it is acting as a **http** proxy, if this had been a TCP proxy then the value for mode had been **tcp**. This had been described in more detail later._


- defaults : _The defaults section defines additional logging parameters and options related to timeouts and errors. By default, both normal and error messages will be logged._

- frontend : _When you configure load balancing using HAProxy, there are two types of nodes which need to be defined: **frontend** and **backend**. The frontend is the node by which HAProxy listens for connections. Backend nodes are those by which HAProxy can forward requests. A third node type, the stats node, can be used to monitor the load balancer and the other two nodes._
_In the above template file, the frontend node named haproxynode, which is bound to all network interfaces on port 80. It will listen for HTTP connections (it is possible to use TCP mode for other purposes) and it will use the back end backend nodes._

- backend : _This defines the back end  backendnodes and specifies several configuration options such as  the **balance** setting specifies the load-balancing strategy. In the above template, roundrobin strategy is used. This strategy uses each server in turn but allows for weights to be assigned to each server.Other strategies include static-rr, which is similar to roundrobin but does not allow weights to be adjusted on the fly and leastconn, which will forward requests to the server with the lowest number of connections._
    - _The **forwardfor** option ensures the forwarded request includes the actual client IP address._
    - _The first **http-request** line allows the forwarded request to include the port of the client HTTP request. The second adds the proto-header containing https if ssl_fc, a HAProxy system variable, returns true. This will be the case if the connection was first made via an SSL/TLS transport layer._
    - _Option **httpchk** defines the check HAProxy uses to test if a web server is still valid for forwarding requests. If the server does not respond to the defined request it will not be used for load balancing until it passes the test._
    - _The server lines define the actual server nodes and their IP addresses, to which IP addresses will be forwarded. The servers defined here are node1 and node2, each of which will use the health check you have defined._

- listen : _This is an optional node in the configuration which adds the capability  of querying HAProxy about its status  using an HTTP statistics page.The statistics can be consulted either from the unix socket or from the HTTP page. Both means provide a CSV format as well . In the above template, HAProxy stats node will listen on port 32700 for connections and is configured to hide the version of HAProxy as well as to require a password login. The password offcourse can be replaced with a more convincing one :)._

For a list of all the available fields which can be used to monitor the statistics, and retrieving the output on unix sockets refer the statistics and monitoring section under the [management guide](http://cbonte.github.io/haproxy-dconv/2.3/management.html#9){:target="_blank"}


#### Layer 7 and Layer 4 Load Balancing

The given template is when HAproxy is acting as a HTTP proxy, i,e at the layer 7 ( application layer). Using the layer 7 allows the load balancer to forward requests to different backend servers based on the content of the userâ€™s request, ACL's and various conditions. This mode of load balancing allows you to run multiple web application servers under the same domain and port.

Load  balancing at layer 4 (transport layer) is the simplest way to load balance network traffic to multiple servers. Load balancing this way will forward user traffic based on IP range and port (i.e. if a request comes in for http://abcd.com/context, the traffic will be forwarded to the backend that handles all the requests for abcd.com on port 80). HAProxy can also be used as a layer 4 load balancer.

Below is a nice Youtube video on the difference between layer 4 and layer 7 loadbalancing and how each of them works. 


[![Layer 4 vs Layer 7](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ylkAc9wmKhc/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ylkAc9wmKhc){:target="_blank"}



I have also written a sample application using node.js, which if you run listens on a given port. You can use this sample app to test the layer 4 and layer 7 load balancing with HAProxy, I have done a small writeup on that as well which you can read [here] 


### Monitoring

With the given template as above, any incoming requests to the HAProxy node at IP address 203.0.113.2 will be forwarded to an internally networked node with an IP address of either 192.168.10.3 or 192.168.10.4. These backend nodes will serve the HTTP requests. If at any time either of these nodes fails the health check, they will not be used to serve any requests until they pass the test.
In order to view statistics and monitor the health of the nodes, navigate to the IP address or domain name of the frontend node in a web browser at the assigned port, e.g., http://203.0.113.2:32700. This will display statistics such as the number of times a request was forwarded to a particular node as well the number of current and previous sessions handled by the frontend node.

### Security , Maintenance

Vulnerabilities are very rarely encountered in haproxy, and its architecture significantly limits their impact and often allows easy workarounds.It is  generally suggested starting HAProxy as root because it can then jail itself in a chroot and drop all of its privileges before starting the instances.

### Performance

HAProxy is an event-driven, non-blocking engine combining a very fast I/O layer with a priority-based, multi-threaded scheduler. As it is designed with a data forwarding goal in mind, its architecture is optimized to move data as fast as  possible with the least possible operations. It focuses on optimizing the CPU cache's efficiency by sticking connections to the same CPU as long as possible.As such it implements a layered model offering bypass mechanisms at each level ensuring data doesn't reach higher levels unless needed. Most of the processing is performed in the kernel, and HAProxy does its best to help the kernel do the work as fast as possible by giving some hints or by avoiding certain operation when it guesses they could be grouped later. As a result, typical figures show 15% of the processing time spent in HAProxy versus 85% in the kernel in TCP or HTTP close mode, and about 30% for HAProxy versus 70% for the kernel in HTTP keep-alive mode.

A single process can run many proxy instances; configurations as large as 300000 distinct proxies in a single process were reported to run fine. A single core, single CPU setup is far more than enough for more than 99% users, and as such, users of containers and virtual machines are encouraged to use the absolute smallest images they can get to save on operational costs and simplify
troubleshooting. However the machine HAProxy runs on must never ever swap, and its CPU must not be artificially throttled (sub-CPU allocation in hypervisors) nor be shared with compute-intensive processes which would induce a very high context-switch latency.
