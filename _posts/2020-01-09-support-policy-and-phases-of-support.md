**Support Life cycle  for Red Hat JBoss EAP and JWS Products**

  

**Phase 1: Full Support**

  

Full support is provided according to the published [Scope of Coverage](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/production/soc/) and [Service Level Agreement](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/production/sla/). Likewise, Development Support is provided according to the published [Scope of Coverage](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/developer/soc/) and [Service Level Agreement](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/developer/sla/). All available and qualified patches will be applied via periodic product updates and CPs, or as required for qualified security patches.

  

**Phase 2: Maintenance Support**

  

Production support is provided according to the published [Scope of Coverage](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/production/soc/) and [Service Level Agreement](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/production/sla/). Likewise, Development Support is provided according to the published [Scope of Coverage](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/developer/soc/) and [Service Level Agreement](https://access.redhat.com/site/support/offerings/developer/sla/). During the maintenance phase, qualified security patches of Critical or Important impact, as well as select mission-critical bug-fix patches, will be released.

**Phase 3: Extended Life Support**

  

Extended Life support is provided according to the published Scope of Coverage and Service Level Agreement. Unlike Full Support and Maintenance Support phases, this support phase requires an ELS subscription in addition to a supported product’s base subscription. The different ELS subscriptions are as below:

  

**ELS-1**

ELS-1 delivers Critical impact security fixes and selected urgent-priority bug fixes, if and when available. For ELS-1 subscribers, Red Hat will generally continue to proactively provide the Critical impact security fixes if and when available independent of customer requests. ELS-1 is generally available for 3 years following the end of Maintenance Support.

  

**ELS-2**

ELS-2 support is offered after the end of the ELS-1. ELS-2 provides limited ongoing technical support to include: Advice and guidance for migrating to current product releases, problem evaluation and workarounds. Bug fixes, security fixes, hardware enablement or root-cause analysis (other than to determine possible workarounds) are not available during this phase, and support is limited to existing installations only. The duration of ELS-2 support is scheduled for 3 years and may be extended on a product-by-product basis.
