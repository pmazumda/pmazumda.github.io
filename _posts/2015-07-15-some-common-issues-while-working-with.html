<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"><h2 style="text-align: left;"><span style="color: blue; text-align: justify;">Issue 1: <span style="font-weight: normal;">&nbsp; </span></span><span style="font-size: small; font-weight: normal; text-align: justify;">While I was deploying a bpel service through the enterprise manager console the deployment was sucessful but there were issues while testing the deployable, &nbsp;the WSDL url was getting wrongly parsed, like I had the url something like this coming up in the browser while testing the service from the EM.</span></h2><div><span style="font-weight: normal;"><a href="http://soadev01.dev.cs.testenv.com/soa-infra">http://soadev01.dev.cs.testenv.com:80/soa-infra</a></span></div><div><br /></div><div><span style="font-weight: normal;">The Problem was it was taking the reference of the &nbsp;hostname &nbsp;and the port from the &nbsp;Frontend Host and Frontend Port from Weblogic which &nbsp;I had mentioned as soadev01 and &nbsp;80 respectively.</span></div><div><br /></div><div><div>As we know the HTTP frontendHost is set when the Host information coming from the URL may be inaccurate due to the presence of a firewall or proxy. If this parameter is set, the HOST header is ignored and this value is always used and so for my case as well the host and the port mentioned in the config plan of the service was being ignored.</div><div><br /></div><div>I removed these parameters and restarted the soa managed servers on the Weblogic and done, I was able to test the service sucessfully.</div></div><div><br /></div></div>
