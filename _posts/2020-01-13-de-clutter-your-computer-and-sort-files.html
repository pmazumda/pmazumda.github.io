<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">Is your computer filled with downloaded files&nbsp; that sometimes you take hours, if not minutes to search through a specific file which&nbsp; you need to send some - one has asked for.<br /><div><br /></div><div>I tend to download a lot of tutorials, pdfs, libraries , executable , zips etc for my work and&nbsp; someday when I go thorough my&nbsp; system, I even don't remember which files are kept where. It feels great to&nbsp; have a clean&nbsp; organized computer with all the files sorted based on their extension but it is not easy and requires a lot of discipline and patience :)&nbsp; At least for me as you can see the before and after&nbsp; situation of running this program.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>There are&nbsp; tools and software ( both paid and the free ones, some are trial version which puts limit on the number of&nbsp; files that can be sorted :) available in the market but I am not looking for those, hence I have created this simple python program to de-clutter your box and sort files based on the extension.&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>This requires Python to run, so you need to install python in your machine first in order to execute this.&nbsp; I am still working on a executable version of&nbsp; this program so&nbsp; you need not install python but that's still work in progress and I will definitely put&nbsp; up a link to the program once it is ready.</div><div>For the time being ,&nbsp; if you&nbsp; want to use this program, you can download&nbsp; Python from&nbsp; the official site&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Here</a>&nbsp;.</div><div><br /></div><div><br /></div><div><div><span style="white-space: pre;">      </span>&nbsp;

   ## Write the name of the directory here that you want to sort and declutter, below is my desktop which was the most unorganized place in my laptop :). You can use your own
   
   path = "C:/Users/pinak.mazumdar/Desktop"
   
   ## This will create a list of all the files in the given path
   
   filelist_ = os.listdir(path)

   for file_ in filelist_:
   name, ext = os.path.splitext(file_)
   
   # This is going to store the extension type
   ext = ext[1:]
   
   # This forces the next iteration
   # if it is the directory
   
   if ext == '':
