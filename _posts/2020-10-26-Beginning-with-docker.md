## Beginning with  Docker.. 


1. To get the basic information about your Docker configuration, execute:

     `$ docker info`

    The out put will be as which contains  information about the storage driver and the  docker root directory.
     Storage Driver: overlay2
     Docker Root Dir: /var/lib/docker

2.  To get the storage location of the docker images and containers. 

  - Ubuntu: /var/lib/docker/
  - Fedora: /var/lib/docker/
  - Debian: /var/lib/docker/
  - Windows: C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop
  - MacOS: ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/
  
  
3. Windows and MacOs OS works in a slighly different maner while running containers, In macOS and Windows, Docker runs Linux containers in a virtual environment. For MacOS,        virtual image data is located in:  

    ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0

   Within the virtual image, the path is the default Docker path /var/lib/docker.

   You can investigate your Docker root directory by creating a shell in the virtual environment: 
   
   $ screen ~/Library/Containers/com.docker.docker/Data/vms/0/tty 


4. On Windows, Linux containers are run in a minimal Hyper-V based virtual environment. The configuration and the virtual image to execute linux images are saved in the default    Docker root folder.

    C:\ProgramData\DockerDesktop

    If you inspect regular images then you will get linux paths like:

    $ docker inspect nginx

    ...
    "UpperDir": "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/diff"
    ...
    You can connect to the virtual image by:

    docker run -it --privileged --pid=host debian nsenter -t 1 -m -u -i sh

5. There, you can go to the referenced location:
```
      $ cd /var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/
      $ ls -lah

      drwx------    4 root     root        4.0K Feb  6 06:56 .
      drwx------   13 root     root        4.0K Feb  6 09:17 ..
      drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Feb  6 06:56 diff
      -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          26 Feb  6 06:56 link
      -rw-r--r--    1 root     root          57 Feb  6 06:56 lower
      drwx------    2 root     root        4.0K Feb  6 06:56 work
```
6.  Inside  the /var/lib/docker folder,  different information are stored for example  data for containers, volumes, builds, networks, and clusters. The internal  stricture of 
     the docker root directory is as below
```
      $ ls -la /var/lib/docker

      total 152
      drwx--x--x   15 root     root          4096 Feb  1 13:09 .
      drwxr-xr-x   13 root     root          4096 Aug  1  2019 ..
      drwx------    2 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 builder
      drwx------    4 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 buildkit
      drwx------    3 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 containerd
      drwx------    2 root     root         12288 Feb  3 19:35 containers
      drwx------    3 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 image
      drwxr-x---    3 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 network
      drwx------    6 root     root         77824 Feb  3 19:37 overlay2
      drwx------    4 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 plugins
      drwx------    2 root     root          4096 Feb  1 13:09 runtimes
      drwx------    2 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 swarm
      drwx------    2 root     root          4096 Feb  3 19:37 tmp
      drwx------    2 root     root          4096 May 20  2019 trust
      drwx------   15 root     root         12288 Feb  3 19:35 volumes
 ```   
7. If using the default storage driver ###overlay2, then the  Docker images are stored in /var/lib/docker/overlay2. There,  you can find different files that represent read-      only layers of a Docker image and a layer on top of it that contains your changes.
```  
      $ docker image pull nginx
      $ docker image inspect nginx
```
[
    {
        "Id": "sha256:207...6e1",
        "RepoTags": [
            "nginx:latest"
        ],
        "RepoDigests": [
            "nginx@sha256:ad5...c6f"
        ],
        "Parent": "",
 ...
        "Architecture": "amd64",
        "Os": "linux",
        "Size": 126698063,
        "VirtualSize": 126698063,
        "GraphDriver": {
            "Data": {
                "LowerDir": "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/diff:
                             /var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/diff",
                "MergedDir": "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/merged",
                "UpperDir": "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/diff",
                "WorkDir": "/var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/work"
            },
...

The LowerDir contains the read-only layers of an image. The read-write layer that represents changes are part of the UpperDir. In my case, the NGINX UpperDir folder contains the log files:
```
$ ls -la /var/lib/docker/overlay2/585...9eb/diff

total 8
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root    4096 Feb  2 08:06 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root    4096 Feb  2 08:06 ..
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root      11 Feb  2 08:06 access.log -> /dev/stdout
lrwxrwxrwx    1 root     root      11 Feb  2 08:06 error.log -> /dev/stderr
```

The MergedDir represents the result of the UpperDir and LowerDir that is used by Docker to run the container. The WorkDir is an internal directory for overlay2 and should be empty.

Docker Volumes
It is possible to add a persistent store to containers to keep data longer than the container exists or to share the volume with the host or with other containers. A container can be started with a volume by using the -v option:
```
$ docker run --name nginx_container -v /var/log nginx
```
We can get information about the connected volume location by:
```
$ docker inspect nginx_container
```
...
"Mounts": [
            {
                "Type": "volume",
                "Name": "1e4...d9c",
                "Source": "/var/lib/docker/volumes/1e4...d9c/_data",
                "Destination": "/var/log",
                "Driver": "local",
                "Mode": "",
                "RW": true,
                "Propagation": ""
            }
        ],
...
The referenced directory contains files from the location /var/log of the NGINX container.
```
$ ls -lah /var/lib/docker/volumes/1e4...d9c/_data

total 88
drwxr-xr-x    4 root     root        4.0K Feb  3 21:02 .
drwxr-xr-x    3 root     root        4.0K Feb  3 21:02 ..
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        4.0K Feb  3 21:02 apt
-rw-rw----    1 root     43             0 Jan 30 00:00 btmp
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root       34.7K Feb  2 08:06 dpkg.log
-rw-r--r--    1 root     root        3.2K Feb  2 08:06 faillog
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     43         29.1K Feb  2 08:06 lastlog
drwxr-xr-x    2 root     root        4.0K Feb  3 21:02 nginx
-rw-rw-r--    1 root     43             0 Jan 30 00:00 w
```


Cleaning up  space used by Docker

Most of the times the storage used by the docker can fill up quite quickly, we need to investigate it clean it up. It is recommended to use the Docker command to clean up unused containers, images. Container, networks, images, and the build cache can be cleaned up by executing:
```
$ docker system prune -a
```
Additionally, you can also remove unused volumes by executing:
```
$ docker volumes prune
```
## Summary 

Docker is an important part of many peopleâ€™s environments and tooling. Sometimes, Docker feels a bit like magic by solving issues in a very smart way without telling the user how things are done behind the scenes. Still, Docker is a regular tool that stores its heavy parts in locations that can be opened and changed.
