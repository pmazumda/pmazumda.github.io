This is Pinak Mazumdar, I live in Bangalore  or Bengaluru ,  India. The Centre of India's high-tech industry and widely regarded as the "Silicon Valley" of India. Some of the major IT giants  has their headquarters housed here. Apart from the tech side, the city also has a lot of historical importance which dates back to  around 890 AD. There are a lot of important and magnificent tourist destinations as well around the city. I came here in the year 2007 and since then living here. At present I am working as a Senior IT consultant for  a  leading  IT company. Apart from an IT engineer , my interests involve travelling, photography, cooking. I have travelled across India, Asia, Africa, Middle-east countries.  

The idea behind working on this blog is I  am very strong believer in the above words.. I mean **yes**  daily we come across so many issues for which some of us might have a already known solution but not all of us. It's always good to receive positive and constructive feedback for your work - hence I would be more than happy if you have any suggestions or any other solution or ideas and feel free to scribe it down in my blog which I am working on where you can present your ideas and I will create a page. As of now you can mail me if you have any suggestions.

As it is being said :

>"In today's environment, hoarding knowledge ultimately erodes your power. If you know something very important, the way to get power is by actually sharing it!"
